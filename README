RaspberryPi Application Launcher -- Qt Quick 1.1 Application

Provides a Tabbed Interface to Launch Applications From. 
    Note: Currently this is Limitied to 1 Application 
          at a time -- something to fix already =D

The Applications are arranged on each Tab page in a Grid, and 
    Provide a Title, Icon Image and Description.  The First
    Few Lines of the Description are always visible with the
    lower portion becoming visible after the user clicks on it.

Suggestion: When an Application Fails to Launch Suppress
            Errors and Launch Package Manager for the Given App


Notes about Limitations of the Software in it's Current State:
    1. Can only Run 1 Application before Freezing RaspPiApp
       due to procExec.h only have 1 QProcess
    2. Re-Sizing Gets Messed Up. I have to Investigate this, and
       Setting Up the main.qml to Take up All of the Window Size
    3. There's more but I can't think of it


Notes about the Future:
    1. Transitions might need to be removed for performance on
       the actual hardware.
    2. QProcess would need to be implimented or we can use
       rewrite it using basic linux sys calls. QProcess is just
       an abstraction. I'm assuming it will exist since we are
       suppose to get Qt5 for the RaspberryPi.
    3. There's more but I can't think of it
