RaspberryPi Application Launcher -- Qt Quick 1.1 Application

Provides a Tabbed Interface to Launch Applications From. 
    Note: Currently this is Limitied to 1 Application 
          at a time -- something to fix already =D

The Applications are arranged on each Tab page in a Grid, and 
    Provide a Title, Icon Image and Description.  The First
    Few Lines of the Description are always visible with the
    lower portion becoming visible after the user clicks on it.
